Income Tax Slabs for Old and New Regimes
The foundation of income tax calculation lies in the applicable tax slabs, which define the tax rate for different ranges of income. For the assessment year 2026-27, corresponding to the financial year 2025-26, both the old and new tax regimes have specific slab structures. The old tax regime's structure varies based on the age of the individual taxpayer. For individuals below 60 years of age, the income tax slabs start with a nil tax rate for income up to ₹2.5 lakh, followed by 5% for income between ₹2.5 lakh and ₹5 lakh, 20% for income between ₹5 lakh and ₹10 lakh, and 30% for income above ₹10 lakh. This long-standing structure provides a sense of familiarity but might result in a higher tax burden if substantial deductions are not claimed.   

Senior citizens, aged between 60 and 80 years, benefit from a slightly higher basic exemption limit under the old regime, with no tax on income up to ₹3 lakh. The subsequent slabs remain the same as for individuals below 60 years: 5% for income between ₹3 lakh and ₹5 lakh, 20% for income between ₹5 lakh and ₹10 lakh, and 30% for income above ₹10 lakh. Super senior citizens, those above 80 years of age, have the highest basic exemption limit under the old regime, with no tax on income up to ₹5 lakh. Their tax liability then follows with a 20% rate for income between ₹5 lakh and ₹10 lakh, and 30% for income above ₹10 lakh.   

In contrast, the new tax regime, introduced to simplify the tax structure, offers a different set of income tax slabs that are uniform across all age groups. As per the latest budget in 2025, this regime starts with a nil tax rate for income up to ₹4 lakh, followed by 5% for income between ₹4 lakh and ₹8 lakh, 10% for income between ₹8 lakh and ₹12 lakh, 15% for income between ₹12 lakh and ₹16 lakh, 20% for income between ₹16 lakh and ₹20 lakh, 25% for income between ₹20 lakh and ₹24 lakh, and 30% for income above ₹24 lakh. This revised slab structure, with a higher initial exemption limit, aims to benefit taxpayers, particularly those in lower to middle-income brackets.   

A significant advantage of the new tax regime is the enhanced tax rebate under Section 87A. This rebate effectively means that individuals with a total income of up to ₹12 lakh under the new regime will have no tax liability. For salaried individuals, this tax-free limit extends to ₹12.75 lakh due to the standard deduction of ₹75,000 available under this regime. This substantial rebate makes the new regime a particularly attractive option for a significant portion of the tax-paying population.   

Beyond the income tax rates, a surcharge is levied on the income tax liability for higher income earners in both regimes. The surcharge rates vary based on the total income. Notably, the maximum surcharge rate in the new tax regime is capped at 25%, whereas it can go up to 37% in the old tax regime. This difference suggests that for individuals with very high incomes, the new regime might be more beneficial, especially if their eligible deductions under the old regime are not substantial enough to offset the impact of the higher surcharge.   

To provide a clear overview, the following table summarizes the income tax slabs for FY 2025-26 (AY 2026-27):

Income Tax Slab (₹)	Old Tax Regime (Below 60 years)	Old Tax Regime (Senior Citizen)	Old Tax Regime (Super Senior Citizen)	New Tax Regime

Deductions under the Old Tax Regime (Sections and Limits)
A key distinguishing feature of the old tax regime is the availability of numerous sections under the Income Tax Act that allow taxpayers to claim deductions on specific investments and expenditures, thereby reducing their taxable income. These deductions contribute to the complexity of the old regime but offer significant opportunities for tax savings for those who make eligible investments and incur qualifying expenses.   

One of the most popular sections is Section 80C, which allows a maximum deduction of ₹1.5 lakh for investments in various instruments like Public Provident Fund (PPF), Employee Provident Fund (EPF), Life Insurance Premium, Equity Linked Savings Schemes (ELSS), National Savings Certificates (NSC), principal repayment of home loans, and tuition fees for children. Related to this are Section 80CCC for investments in certain pension funds and Section 80CCD(1) for contributions to the National Pension Scheme (NPS), both also having a maximum deduction limit of ₹1.5 lakh, which is combined with Section 80C under an overall limit. An additional deduction of up to ₹50,000 for investments in NPS is available under Section 80CCD(1B), which is over and above the ₹1.5 lakh limit.   

For healthcare expenses, Section 80D provides deductions for medical insurance premiums paid for self, spouse, children, and parents, with the maximum limit varying based on the age of the insured, potentially reaching up to ₹1 lakh. Section 80DD allows deductions for medical treatment of a dependent with a disability, with the amount depending on the severity of the disability. Similarly, Section 80DDB offers deductions for medical expenditure on the treatment of specified diseases, with higher limits for senior citizens.   

Individuals paying interest on loans taken for higher education can claim a deduction under Section 80E without any upper limit, for a period of up to 8 assessment years. First-time homebuyers could avail a deduction of up to ₹50,000 on the interest paid on their housing loan under Section 80EE, subject to certain conditions. Further deductions for interest paid on housing loans are available under Section 80EEA for affordable housing and Section 80EEB for the purchase of electric vehicles, both with a limit of ₹1.5 lakh.   

Donations to specified charitable institutions and funds are eligible for deduction under Section 80G, with the amount of deduction varying based on the type of institution. Taxpayers who do not receive House Rent Allowance (HRA) from their employer but pay rent can claim a deduction under Section 80GG, subject to certain conditions and limits. Interest earned on savings accounts can be claimed as a deduction under Section 80TTA (up to ₹10,000 for non-senior citizens) and Section 80TTB (up to ₹50,000 for senior citizens). Individuals with disabilities can claim deductions under Section 80U, with the amount depending on the extent of the disability.   

Apart from these investment-linked and expenditure-linked deductions, the old tax regime also provides a standard deduction. For salaried individuals below 60 years of age, the standard deduction is ₹50,000, while for senior citizens, it has been increased to ₹1 lakh as per the latest budget. While the new tax regime offers a higher standard deduction of ₹75,000 for all salaried individuals, the old regime's extensive list of other deduction opportunities can potentially lead to greater overall tax savings for those who actively invest and spend in eligible avenues.   

The following table summarizes some of the key deductions available under the old tax regime for FY 2025-26:

Section Number	Description (Investment/Expenditure Type)	Maximum Deduction Limit (₹)
80C	Investments in PPF, EPF, LIC, ELSS, NSC, Home Loan Principal, Tuition Fees	1,50,000
80CCC	Investment in certain Pension Funds	1,50,000 (combined with 80C)
80CCD(1)	Contribution to National Pension Scheme (NPS)	1,50,000 (combined with 80C)
80CCD(1B)	Additional Contribution to NPS	50,000
80D	Medical Insurance Premium	Up to 1,00,000
80E	Interest paid on Education Loan	No limit

Analysis of Existing Tax Calculator Websites (UI/UX)
Several online platforms in India offer income tax calculators to assist taxpayers in estimating their tax liability. Examining their user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) can provide valuable insights for developing an effective and user-friendly tool. Many existing calculators, such as those provided by Zoho Payroll, ClearTax, and Groww, effectively employ a side-by-side comparison of the tax liability under both the old and new regimes. This layout allows users to quickly see the potential difference in their tax obligations based on their inputs.   

Clear and well-labeled input fields for salary and various deduction sections are also common and contribute to a positive user experience, as seen in calculators like Groww and ClearTax. The Income Tax Department's own calculator provides a summary of inputs and the calculated tax at the end, which helps users review the information they have entered. This approach ensures transparency and allows for easy verification.   

However, some areas for improvement exist across various platforms. Certain calculators might present an overwhelming number of input fields without sufficient context or guidance, potentially confusing users who are not tax experts. For instance, a long list of deduction sections without clear explanations of what qualifies under each might deter users or lead to incorrect entries. Providing tooltips or brief descriptions for each input field could significantly enhance user understanding. Furthermore, while many calculators show the final tax amount, some lack a detailed breakdown of the calculation logic, leaving users unsure about how the result was derived. Offering an option to view a detailed calculation, including the tax applied at each income slab, would improve transparency and build user trust.   

Modern UI/UX design principles, as showcased on platforms like Dribbble for financial applications , emphasize clean layouts, intuitive navigation, and the use of visual aids. Incorporating these principles into the tax calculator's design is crucial. A clean and uncluttered interface with clear sections for input and output, descriptive labels for all fields, and responsive design to ensure usability across different devices are essential for a positive user experience. Visual aids, such as bar charts comparing the tax liabilities under the two regimes, can also make the information more easily digestible.
