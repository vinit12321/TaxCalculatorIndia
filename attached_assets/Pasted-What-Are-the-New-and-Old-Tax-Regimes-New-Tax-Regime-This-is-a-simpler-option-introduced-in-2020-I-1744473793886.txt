What Are the New and Old Tax Regimes?
New Tax Regime: This is a simpler option introduced in 2020. It has lower tax rates, but you can’t claim most deductions (like investments or medical insurance). It’s great if you don’t have many deductions.
Old Tax Regime: This is the traditional system. It has higher tax rates but lets you reduce your taxable income with deductions (like savings under Section 80C or house rent allowance). It’s better if you have significant deductions.
You can pick whichever regime saves you more money.

New Tax Regime: Calculation for ₹26,00,000
In the new tax regime, your income is split into slabs, and each slab has a different tax rate. You don’t get any deductions, so we use the full ₹26,00,000 for the calculation. Here’s how it works:

Tax Slabs for New Regime
₹0 to ₹3,00,000: 0% tax (no tax)
₹3,00,001 to ₹6,00,000: 5% tax
₹6,00,001 to ₹9,00,000: 10% tax
₹9,00,001 to ₹12,00,000: 15% tax
₹12,00,001 to ₹15,00,000: 20% tax
Above ₹15,00,000: 30% tax
Formula in Simple English
The formula is:

Tax = (Tax rate × Income in each slab) added up for all slabs + 4% cess on the total tax.

We break your income into parts based on these slabs and calculate the tax for each part.

Step-by-Step Calculation
Let’s apply this to ₹26,00,000:

First ₹3,00,000 (₹0 to ₹3,00,000):
Tax rate = 0%
Tax = 0% of ₹3,00,000 = ₹0
Next ₹3,00,000 (₹3,00,001 to ₹6,00,000):
Tax rate = 5%
Tax = 5% of ₹3,00,000 = ₹15,000
(To calculate: ₹3,00,000 × 5 ÷ 100 = ₹15,000)
Next ₹3,00,000 (₹6,00,001 to ₹9,00,000):
Tax rate = 10%
Tax = 10% of ₹3,00,000 = ₹30,000
(₹3,00,000 × 10 ÷ 100 = ₹30,000)
Next ₹3,00,000 (₹9,00,001 to ₹12,00,000):
Tax rate = 15%
Tax = 15% of ₹3,00,000 = ₹45,000
(₹3,00,000 × 15 ÷ 100 = ₹45,000)
Next ₹3,00,000 (₹12,00,001 to ₹15,00,000):
Tax rate = 20%
Tax = 20% of ₹3,00,000 = ₹60,000
(₹3,00,000 × 20 ÷ 100 = ₹60,000)
Remaining ₹11,00,000 (₹15,00,001 to ₹26,00,000):
Total income = ₹26,00,000
Income taxed so far = ₹15,00,000 (₹3,00,000 + ₹3,00,000 + ₹3,00,000 + ₹3,00,000 + ₹3,00,000)
Remaining = ₹26,00,000 - ₹15,00,000 = ₹11,00,000
Tax rate = 30%
Tax = 30% of ₹11,00,000 = ₹3,30,000
(₹11,00,000 × 30 ÷ 100 = ₹3,30,000)
Total Tax Before Cess
Add up the tax from each slab:

₹0 + ₹15,000 + ₹30,000 + ₹45,000 + ₹60,000 + ₹3,30,000 = ₹4,80,000

Add 4% Cess
There’s an extra 4% health and education cess on the total tax:

Cess = 4% of ₹4,80,000
Cess = ₹4,80,000 × 4 ÷ 100 = ₹19,200
Final Tax under New Regime
Total tax = Tax before cess + Cess

₹4,80,000 + ₹19,200 = ₹4,99,200

So, under the new tax regime, your tax for ₹26,00,000 is ₹4,99,200.

Old Tax Regime: Calculation for ₹26,00,000
In the old tax regime, the slabs are different, and you can lower your taxable income with deductions. I’ll show you two scenarios: one without deductions and one with some deductions, so you see how it works.

Tax Slabs for Old Regime
₹0 to ₹2,50,000: 0% tax (no tax)
₹2,50,001 to ₹5,00,000: 5% tax
₹5,00,001 to ₹10,00,000: 20% tax
Above ₹10,00,000: 30% tax
Formula in Simple English
The formula is:

Tax = (Tax rate × Income in each slab) added up for all slabs + 4% cess on the total tax.

But first, you subtract your deductions from your total income to get your taxable income, then apply the slabs to that amount.

Scenario 1: No Deductions
Let’s calculate for ₹26,00,000 without any deductions.

Step-by-Step Calculation
First ₹2,50,000 (₹0 to ₹2,50,000):
Tax rate = 0%
Tax = 0% of ₹2,50,000 = ₹0
Next ₹2,50,000 (₹2,50,001 to ₹5,00,000):
Tax rate = 5%
Tax = 5% of ₹2,50,000 = ₹12,500
(₹2,50,000 × 5 ÷ 100 = ₹12,500)
Next ₹5,00,000 (₹5,00,001 to ₹10,00,000):
Tax rate = 20%
Tax = 20% of ₹5,00,000 = ₹1,00,000
(₹5,00,000 × 20 ÷ 100 = ₹1,00,000)
Remaining ₹16,00,000 (₹10,00,001 to ₹26,00,000):
Total income = ₹26,00,000
Income taxed so far = ₹10,00,000 (₹2,50,000 + ₹2,50,000 + ₹5,00,000)
Remaining = ₹26,00,000 - ₹10,00,000 = ₹16,00,000
Tax rate = 30%
Tax = 30% of ₹16,00,000 = ₹4,80,000
(₹16,00,000 × 30 ÷ 100 = ₹4,80,000)
Total Tax Before Cess
Add up the tax from each slab:

₹0 + ₹12,500 + ₹1,00,000 + ₹4,80,000 = ₹5,92,500

Add 4% Cess
Cess = 4% of ₹5,92,500

Cess = ₹5,92,500 × 4 ÷ 100 = ₹23,700

Final Tax Without Deductions
Total tax = ₹5,92,500 + ₹23,700 = ₹6,16,200

So, without deductions, your tax is ₹6,16,200, which is higher than the new regime’s ₹4,99,200.

Scenario 2: With ₹3,00,000 Deductions
Now, let’s say you have deductions worth ₹3,00,000 (e.g., ₹1,50,000 under Section 80C for investments, ₹50,000 standard deduction, and ₹1,00,000 for house rent allowance).

Taxable income = Total income - Deductions
Taxable income = ₹26,00,000 - ₹3,00,000 = ₹23,00,000
Step-by-Step Calculation
First ₹2,50,000:
Tax rate = 0%
Tax = ₹0
Next ₹2,50,000 (₹2,50,001 to ₹5,00,000):
Tax rate = 5%
Tax = 5% of ₹2,50,000 = ₹12,500
Next ₹5,00,000 (₹5,00,001 to ₹10,00,000):
Tax rate = 20%
Tax = 20% of ₹5,00,000 = ₹1,00,000
Remaining ₹13,00,000 (₹10,00,001 to ₹23,00,000):
Total taxable income = ₹23,00,000
Income taxed so far = ₹10,00,000
Remaining = ₹23,00,000 - ₹10,00,000 = ₹13,00,000
Tax rate = 30%
Tax = 30% of ₹13,00,000 = ₹3,90,000
(₹13,00,000 × 30 ÷ 100 = ₹3,90,000)
Total Tax Before Cess
₹0 + ₹12,500 + ₹1,00,000 + ₹3,90,000 = ₹5,02,500

Add 4% Cess
Cess = 4% of ₹5,02,500 = ₹20,100

Final Tax With ₹3,00,000 Deductions
Total tax = ₹5,02,500 + ₹20,100 = ₹5,22,600

This is still higher than the new regime’s ₹4,99,200.

Scenario 3: With ₹5,00,000 Deductions
If your deductions are ₹5,00,000:

Taxable income = ₹26,00,000 - ₹5,00,000 = ₹21,00,000
Step-by-Step Calculation
First ₹2,50,000: ₹0
Next ₹2,50,000: 5% of ₹2,50,000 = ₹12,500
Next ₹5,00,000: 20% of ₹5,00,000 = ₹1,00,000
Remaining ₹11,00,000 (₹10,00,001 to ₹21,00,000):
Remaining = ₹21,00,000 - ₹10,00,000 = ₹11,00,000
Tax = 30% of ₹11,00,000 = ₹3,30,000
Total Tax Before Cess
₹0 + ₹12,500 + ₹1,00,000 + ₹3,30,000 = ₹4,42,500

Add 4% Cess
Cess = 4% of ₹4,42,500 = ₹17,700

Final Tax With ₹5,00,000 Deductions
Total tax = ₹4,42,500 + ₹17,700 = ₹4,60,200

Now, this is lower than the new regime’s ₹4,99,200.

Summary of Taxes
New Regime: ₹4,99,200 (no deductions allowed)
Old Regime:
No deductions: ₹6,16,200
₹3,00,000 deductions: ₹5,22,600
₹5,00,000 deductions: ₹4,60,200
Logic in Simple Terms
New Regime: You pay tax on your full income using the slabs. It’s straightforward but doesn’t let you reduce your income.
Old Regime: You subtract deductions first, then pay tax on what’s left using different slabs. The more deductions you have, the less tax you pay.
